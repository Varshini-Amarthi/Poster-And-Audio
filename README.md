# Varshi's Ringtone Download Web App

Welcome to **Varshi's Playlist** – a simple and elegant HTML project that allows users to **view, listen, and download their favorite songs as ringtones** directly from the browser. The app showcases a curated set of movie posters with corresponding ringtones that autoplay (muted and looped), and provides direct download links for each. Users can enjoy previewing audio clips while visually browsing through popular movies like *Sita Ramam*, *Hi Nanna*, *Bommarillu*, *The Family Star*, *Ninnu Kori*, *Geetha Govindham*, *Court*, and *Orange*.

This project is built using only **HTML** with no external CSS or JavaScript dependencies. It uses the `<audio>` tag for media control and the `download` attribute of the `<a>` tag for seamless downloading functionality. The layout is arranged using the `<center>` tag and non-breaking spaces for spacing, keeping the code beginner-friendly and clean.

### Features:
-  Preview ringtones in-browser using HTML `<audio>` controls.
-  One-click download of each song using the native `download` attribute.
-  Audio autoplay (muted) and loop enabled for seamless background play.
-  Eye-catching posters for each song, clickable for direct ringtone access.
-  No CSS or JS — pure HTML based for simplicity.

### How to Use:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Click the play button below any image to preview the ringtone.
4. Use the download icon below each poster to save the ringtone.
